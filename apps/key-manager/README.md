# @apps/key-manager

The API key management application for Anteater API.

## Note to Open-Source Contributors

Because this app accesses the API's API key store using the Cloudflare TypeScript library, local development is currently only possible if you are a member of Projects Committee.

Please reach out to the Project Lead if you would like to work on this, and we will be happy to assist you.

We will be adding instructions on setting up your own Cloudflare account for local development in the future.
